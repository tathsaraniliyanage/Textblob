This project leverages TextBlob, a Python library for processing textual data, 
to provide various natural language processing (NLP) functionalities, including:

 * Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Identifying the parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) in text.
 * Sentiment Analysis: Assessing the polarity (positive/negative) and subjectivity of text.
 * Text Translation: Translating text between different languages.
 * Noun Phrase Extraction: Extracting key noun phrases from text.
 * Tokenization: Splitting text into words and sentences.
 * Spelling Correction: Automatically correcting spelling errors.

 
Features:
  Ease of Use: Simple, easy-to-read syntax.
  Pre-built Functions: Ready-to-use NLP functions without the need for extensive setup.
  Built on NLTK: It works as a wrapper over the NLTK library, adding more intuitive methods.
